## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sanjana, a full-stack developer and CS undergraduate based in India.

I code using MERN stack.

I like building creative and useful apps, with keen interest in pixel-perfect visuals. When I'm not coding or designing in Figma, you'll find me lost in a novel, coffee in hand, while thunderstorms roll outside.
